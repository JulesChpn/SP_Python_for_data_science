# SP_Python_for_data_science

## Context

This repository is a project that I did during my Master 1 at ENSAE Paris.

The name of the course was "Python for data science" and took place between October and December 2022.

We were a group of 3 Python neophytes and we passed this course with 17/20.

The course and the instructions can be found on this page : https://pythonds.linogaliana.fr/

## Objectives

We decided to lead a quick study on sport facilities in France :
- where are they located ?
- is there a good match between supply (sport facilities) and demand (sport licences)
- differences between sports
- geographic differences
- what factors influence the number of facilities ?

## How to discover our project

There are 4 notebooks :
- creation_database : we import, clean and merge our different databases
- descriptive_stats : quick statistics to check our databases
- data_visualization : graphs and maps to visualize our results
- modelling : linear regression

## Informations

- Sometimes, graphs and maps do not display correctly
- I copied the whole code but I did not translate every piece of text
- We also had to do an oral presentation
